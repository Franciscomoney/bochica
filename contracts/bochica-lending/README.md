### withdraw() Function Features:

- Transfers funds to creator
- Updates project status to Borrowed

### repay() Function Features:

- Verifies repayment amount covers total due
- Marks loan as repaid
- Updates project status to Repaid

## Smart Contract Complete! ðŸŽ‰

All 4 core functions implemented:
1. **deposit()** - Investors fund projects
2. **withdraw()** - Creators borrow when 100% funded
3. **repay()** - Creators pay back with interest
4. **claim()** - Investors get returns

**Next Steps:**
- Compile and test contract locally
- Deploy to Asset Hub testnet
- Test full lifecycle end-to-end
- Deploy to mainnet
- Update frontend to interact with contract

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Create Project** - Creator sets goal amount and interest rate
2. **Deposit Phase** - Investors deposit USDT (with 2% platform fee)
3. **Withdrawal** - Creator withdraws when 100% funded (30-day loan created)
4. **Repayment** - Creator repays loan + interest
5. **Claim Phase** - Investors claim proportional returns after lockup
