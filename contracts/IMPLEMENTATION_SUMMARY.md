## Example Lifecycle Flow

**Step 1: Create Project**

**Step 2: Deposit Phase**
- Investor A deposits 500 USDT (2% fee = 10 USDT, net = 490 USDT)
- Investor B deposits 520 USDT (2% fee = 10.4 USDT, net = 509.6 USDT)
- Total funding = 999.6 USDT ‚Üí Project status: Funded

**Step 3: Withdrawal**
- Creator withdraws 999.6 USDT
- Loan created: repayment = 1099.56 USDT (10% interest), due in 30 days
- Project status: Borrowed

**Step 4: Repayment**
- Creator repays 1099.56 USDT
- Funds held in contract
- Project status: Repaid

**Step 5: Claim Phase**
- Investor A claims: (490 / 999.6) * 1099.56 = 539.02 USDT (10% profit!)
- Investor B claims: (509.6 / 999.6) * 1099.56 = 560.54 USDT (10% profit!)
