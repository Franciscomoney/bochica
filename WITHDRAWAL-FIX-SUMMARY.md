## üìã BONUS: Automatic Status Update Trigger

### SQL Code Created (Not Yet Applied)
A SQL trigger has been prepared to automatically update project status to 'funded' when the funding goal is reached. This prevents the need for manual status updates in the future.

**File**: /home/debian/bochica/create-trigger.sql

**To Apply**: Run the SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Execute the contents of create-trigger.sql

**What it does**:
- Automatically detects when a project reaches its funding goal
- Updates status from 'active' to 'funded'
- Runs on every new commitment insert
