IMPORTANT: Gas Fees (DOT) Required

Users Need TWO Tokens:
1. USDT - for lending/borrowing
2. DOT - for transaction fees (gas)

Typical Costs on Asset Hub:
- Each USDT transfer: ~0.01 DOT (~/bin/bash.07 USD)
- Investment transaction: 2 transfers = ~0.02 DOT

Recommended DOT Balance:
- Lender: 0.1 DOT minimum
- Creator: 0.5 DOT minimum

Current Implementation:
- Function added: getAssetHubDotBalance() in lib/polkadot.ts
- NOT YET: Display DOT balance in UI
- NOT YET: Warn users before transaction if low DOT
- NOT YET: Check DOT before allowing transaction

See full documentation: GAS-FEES-REQUIREMENTS.md (when created)

CRITICAL: Users will get confusing errors if they try to transact without DOT!
