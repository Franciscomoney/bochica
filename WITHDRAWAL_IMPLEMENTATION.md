# REAL BLOCKCHAIN WITHDRAWAL IMPLEMENTATION

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `/home/debian/bochica/app/api/withdraw/route.ts`

**What it does:**
1. Receives withdrawal request from frontend with projectId and creatorAddress
2. Validates project is fully funded (100% of goal)
3. Validates creator wallet matches project creator
4. Connects to Polkadot Asset Hub blockchain
5. **Uses escrow wallet private key to sign transaction**
6. **Sends REAL USDT from escrow to creator wallet**
7. Creates loan record with interest and due date
8. Updates project status to "borrowing"
9. Returns transaction hash to frontend

**Key Features:**
- No admin approval needed
- Real on-chain USDT transfer
- Server-side signing with escrow wallet
- Automatic loan creation

### Frontend Update
**File:** `/home/debian/bochica/app/project/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changed:** `handleWithdraw()` function now:
1. Calls `/api/withdraw` endpoint
2. Displays transaction hash on success
3. Shows real-time withdrawal status
4. Refreshes project data automatically

### Environment Variables
**File:** `/home/debian/bochica/.env.local`

**Required additions:**
```bash
# Backend API Configuration (REQUIRED for withdrawals)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE
ESCROW_WALLET_SEED=YOUR_TWELVE_WORD_SEED_PHRASE_HERE
```

## üö® CONFIGURATION NEEDED

Before withdrawals will work, you MUST configure:

### 1. Get Supabase Service Role Key
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://fvehyzvdffnxrmupwgtv.supabase.co
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Copy the `service_role` key (NOT the anon key)
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

### 2. Get Escrow Wallet Seed Phrase
The escrow wallet address is: `15SF1r3zuTgRB8yt6mDSTcXtaQZqVv1YpDCyUoV7E3bSJfSf`

You need the 12-word seed phrase that was used to generate this wallet.

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
ESCROW_WALLET_SEED=word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 word7 word8 word9 word10 word11 word12
```

### 3. Rebuild and Restart
After adding the environment variables:
```bash
cd /home/debian/bochica
npm run build
pm2 restart bochica
```

## üìä HOW IT WORKS

### Investment Flow (Already Working)
```
Investor Wallet ‚Üí Batch Transfer ‚Üí [Platform Fee Wallet + Escrow Wallet]
```

### NEW Withdrawal Flow
```
Creator clicks "Withdraw" ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Escrow Wallet ‚Üí Creator Wallet
                              ‚Üì
                        Creates Loan Record
```

### Security
- Escrow private key stored securely in backend environment
- Creator never sees or controls escrow wallet
- Backend validates creator identity before transfer
- Only works if project 100% funded

## üß™ TESTING

### To test the withdrawal:
1. Configure environment variables (above)
2. Rebuild and restart Bochica
3. Create a test project or use existing one
4. Fund project to 100%
5. Creator connects wallet
6. Creator clicks "Withdraw Funds"
7. Check console for transaction hash
8. Verify USDT appears in creator wallet
9. Verify loan record created in database

### Expected Result:
```
Console output:
[WITHDRAWAL] Processing 100 USDT for project abc-123 to 1ABC...xyz
[WITHDRAWAL] Escrow wallet: 15SF...JfSf
[WITHDRAWAL] Submitting transaction...
[WITHDRAWAL] Transaction status: InBlock
[WITHDRAWAL] Transaction hash: 0x123abc...
[WITHDRAWAL] Success! 100 USDT sent to 1ABC...xyz

Frontend:
‚úì Successfully withdrew 100 USDT!
‚úì Transaction: 0x123abc...
‚úì Loan repayment: 105 USDT due 2025-11-15
```

## üîó TRANSACTION VERIFICATION

After withdrawal, verify on Polkadot blockchain:
1. Go to https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/
2. Search for transaction hash
3. Verify:
   - From: Escrow wallet (15SF...)
   - To: Creator wallet
   - Amount: Correct USDT amount
   - Status: Success

## üìù GIT COMMIT

```
commit ecd6ff4
Implement real blockchain withdrawal system

- Backend API endpoint that uses escrow wallet private key
- Signs transactions server-side with platform wallet
- Real USDT transfer from escrow to creator wallet
- No admin approval - automatic if project 100% funded
- Creates loan record with interest and due date
- Frontend calls API instead of fake withdrawal request
```

Pushed to: `production` branch

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **CONFIGURE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** (critical!)
2. Test withdrawal with small amount first
3. Monitor logs during test: `pm2 logs bochica`
4. Verify transaction on blockchain explorer
5. Check loan record in Supabase database

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- ‚úÖ Code committed to git
- ‚úÖ Pushed to production branch
- ‚úÖ Built successfully
- ‚úÖ PM2 restarted
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Environment variables need configuration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Testing pending after env vars configured
